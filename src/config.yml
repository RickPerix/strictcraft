# üõ°Ô∏è STRICTCRAFT CONFIGURATION FILE
# =====================================
# Configure restrictions for commands, gamemodes, block usage, and monitoring
# Plugin version: 1.8 ‚Äì by RickPerix

# -----------------------------
# üîê CORE PROTECTION SETTINGS
# -----------------------------
strictcraft:
  # Whether StrictCraft is active globally
  enabled: true

  # List of players excluded from restrictions
  # These players will NOT be affected by command, gamemode, or block protections

  excluded-players:
    - "ExampleUser"

# -----------------------------
# üö´ BLOCKED COMMAND SETTINGS
# -----------------------------
blocked-commands:
  # List of command prefixes to block for non-whitelisted players
  # Matching is case-insensitive and based on the start of the command
  #
  # To disable command blocking entirely, use:
  #   list:
  #     - ""
  # (Do not remove the list or leave it undefined, as this may cause all commands to be blocked by default)

  list:
    - "/give"
    - "/minecraft:give"
    - "/item"
    - "/minecraft:item"
    - "/enchant"
    - "/minecraft:enchant"
    - "/effect"
    - "/minecraft:effect"
    - "/advancement"
    - "/minecraft:advancement"
    - "/xp"
    - "/minecraft:xp"
    - "/experience"
    - "/minecraft:experience"
    - "/gamemode creative"

  # ‚õî Gamemode blocking logic:
  # When you add a command to the blocked-commands list that contains both "gamemode" and the name of a Minecraft gamemode
  # (creative, spectator, survival, adventure), the plugin will block ALL attempts to switch to that mode, not just the command itself.
  #
  # This means:
  # - Every command that tries to switch the player's gamemode to that mode will be blocked.
  # - The F3+F4 shortcut will be blocked for that mode.
  # - Even if a plugin, the console or a command block tries to change a player's gamemode, it will be blocked.
  #
  # ‚úÖ Example:
  # If you add "/gamemode creative" to the list, the plugin will block:
  # - Every command that tries to switch player's gamemode to creative mode.
  # - F3+F4 shortcut to Creative.
  # - Any plugin, console command or command block that tries to set a player to Creative.
  #
  # The plugin doesn't just block the command, it blocks the actual gamemode change itself.
  # This ensures full protection, no matter how the gamemode switch is triggered.

# -----------------------------
# üéÆ GAME MODE MONITORING

gamemode-enforcement:
  # Whether to activate periodic enforcement of Survival mode
  # If set to false, StrictCraft will not force gamemode changes automatically
