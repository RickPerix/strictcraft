  # These players will NOT be affected by command, gamemode, or block protections

  excluded-players:

# -----------------------------
# üö´ BLOCKED COMMAND SETTINGS
# -----------------------------
blocked-commands:
  # List of command prefixes to block for non-whitelisted players
  # Matching is case-insensitive and based on the start of the command
  #
  # To disable command blocking entirely, use:
  #   list:
  #     - ""
  # (Do not remove the list or leave it undefined, as this may cause all commands to be blocked by default)

  list:
    - "/gmc"
    - "/gm 1"
    - "/gm c"
    - "/gamemode creative"
    - "/gamemode 1"
    - "/gamemode c"
    - "/creative"
    - "/build"
    - "/instantbuild"
    - "/creativefly"
    - "/fly creative"

  # ‚õî F3+F4 shortcut blocking:
  # To block the F3+F4 shortcut that allows players to switch between Minecraft game modes,
  # you need to add specific commands like /gamemode spectator or /gamemode creative to the blocked-commands list.
  # If one of these commands is listed, the shortcut will be blocked for that mode ‚Äî and the command itself will also be blocked.
  #
  # NOTE: commands like /minecraft:gamemode creative are treated the same way,
  # as long as they include both "gamemode" and the name of a Minecraft game mode (creative, spectator, survival, adventure).
  #
  # For example, a command like /customplugin:gamemode adventure will still block the shortcut to Adventure mode,
  # because it contains both "gamemode" and one of the Minecraft game mode names.
  # It doesn't matter what other words or prefixes are included, if those two parts are present,
  # the shortcut to that specific game mode will be blocked.

# -----------------------------
